# Should the daemon insert or append rules in the forward chain.

#
# Tip: If you need to insert rules somewhere in the middle of the PREROUTING
# or FORWARD chains, instead of first or last, then you should create a
# new empty chain, e.g forwardUPnP, and set forward_chain_name to that
# chain. Then insert a rule to jump to forwardUPnP in the appropriate place
# in the PREROUTING or FORWARD chain. (The value of forward_rules_append
# probably won't matter much in that case.)
