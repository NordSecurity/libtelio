BREAKING CHANGE: Remove enhanced detection mode from link detection

 Since every WG implementation libtelio uses, issues a handshake after
  a missed keepalive, "enhanced detection" becomes trivial.

 However WireGuardNT tx counters are not increased when the internet connected
  interface is disabled, which leads to incorrect link state
  detection.

 This PR removes enhanced detection mode from link detection while keeping
  a Windows mod that on network change monitoring trigger, it will
  issue a ICMP to every peer in order to improve reliability of link detection
  on WireguardNT adapters. When that happens it'll also trigger the
  link detection countdown by artificially setting first_tx_after_rx variable.
