Fixes:

    Libvirt VMs routing was being configured only when binaries were pushed, this PR configures it as default for every new ssh connection.
    Exceptions on docker/ssh processes were not being raised against the context manager of the cleanup stage, making pytest hang for the whole test timeout duration. This PR fixes it by running the processes inside a try/except/finally block.
    If telio fails to launch won't set the client proxy port, creating an infinite loop waiting for the port. This PR fixes it by additionally checking if the telio process is running.
    Other logging and duplicated code minor fixes.

Features:

    This PR adds link state check as part of the setup_mesh_nodes() helper function.
    Add enable/disable interface methods to router classes.
